# iMulch Chrome Extension

If you long to garden like I do, but are busy staring into a screen all day, you’ll LOVE iMulch Chrome browser extension. My friend [Melissa Detthloff](http://www.melissadettloff.com/) noticed that everything is better with mulch on it - now you can satisfy that gardening urge right at your screen. Plus you’ll get that productive multi-tasking sensation --I’m working AND mulching-- without the sore muscles and sunburn!

Start MULCHY-tasking!
